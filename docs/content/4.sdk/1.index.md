# Building APIs

A brief introduction to the purpose of the documentation, focusing on building front-end APIs that interact with Odoo.

## Understading api requests

**GET**: In Odoo, GET requests from the client are handled using queries.
**POST and Other HTTP Verbs**: All other operations (POST, PUT, DELETE) are handled as mutations

## Types and Data Structures

Whenever a query or mutation is made, there is an associated type on client side with Odoo type. The client side type represents the expected response format from the Odoo server side.

These response types are defined in a file named _types.ts_, located in the _/graphql directory_.

They are created by observing the return of the query or mutation and structured to ensure that the client side can process the response properly.

Example: For a query that returns cart information, the corresponding client-side type might be _CartResponse_:

```ts
export type CartResponse = AsyncData<
  {
    cart: Cart;
  },
  H3Error
>;
```

For a mutation that removes items from the cart, the corresponding type might be _CartRemoveItemResponse_:

```ts
export type CartRemoveItemResponse = AsyncData<
  {
    cartRemoveMultipleItems: Cart;
  },
  H3Error
>;
```

### Creating Queries

Queries are created in TypeScript files located in the _/server/queries directory_. Each query should have its own file, named according to the query name.

### Simple Query Example

Below is an example of how a query like LoadCartQuery should be structured in the _loadCartQuery.ts_ file:

```ts
import { gql } from '@apollo/client/core';

export default gql`
  query {
    cart {
      order {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

### Creating Mutations

Mutations are created in TypeScript files located in the _/server/mutations_ directory. Each mutation should have its own file, named according to the mutation name.
Below is an example of how a mutation like _CartRemoveItem_ should be structured in the _cartRemoveItem.ts_ file:

```ts
import gql from 'graphql-tag';
import orderFragment from '../fragments/orderFragment';

export default gql`
  mutation ($lineIds: [Int]!) {
    cartRemoveMultipleItems(lineIds: $lineIds) {
      order {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

### Registering Queries and Mutations

All queries must be registered in the _/server/queries/index.ts_ file.

```ts
import LoadCartQuery from './LoadCartQuery';

enum QueryName {
  LoadCartQuery = 'LoadCartQuery',
}

const Queries: Record<QueryName, DocumentNode> = {
  LoadCartQuery,
};

export { Queries, QueryName };
```

All mutations must be registered in the _/server/mutations/index.ts_ file.

```ts
import CartRemoveItem from './CartRemoveItem';

enum MutationName {
  CartRemoveItem = 'CartRemoveItem',
}

const Mutations: Record<MutationName, DocumentNode> = {
  CartRemoveItem,
};

export { Mutations, MutationName };
```

## Code Implementation

Query **without parameters**: When the API does not require parameters, the query can be simple and straightforward.

```ts
const cart = useState<Cart>('cart', () => ({} as Cart));
const { data } = await $sdk().odoo.query<null, CartResponse>({
  queryName: QueryName.LoadCartQuery,
});
cart.value = data.value.cart;
```

Query **with parameters**: When the operation requires parameters, you must pass them in the mutation.

```ts
const cart = useState<Cart>('cart', () => ({} as Cart));

const { data, error } = await $sdk().odoo.mutation<
  MutationCartRemoveMultipleItemsArgs,
  CartRemoveItemResponse
>({ mutationName: MutationName.CartRemoveItem }, params);

cart.value = data.value.cartRemoveMultipleItems;
```
