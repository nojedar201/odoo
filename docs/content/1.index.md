# Demonstration

This documentation is about Odoo integration with Alokai. This integration has been developed and maintained by ERPGAP / PromptEQUATION ❤️

Before anything, you should take a look in our live demo: https://vsfsdk.labs.odoogap.com/ _it's a dev server so could be down sometimes_ :man_shrugging:

::: warning
We need to make clear that this hole documentation is about **Alokai + Odoo - Front End**, not about Odoo Back End. So, take a look in following explanations to better understand how it works.

## Alokai Community Projects explanation

We are Alokai integrators partners, so we make part of Alokai open source community. We keep our available projects in Github Alokai Community (https://github.com/vuestorefront-community) to keep everyting working:

- **ODOO**: Here is where our developer team works to make everything working with the best performance and user experience as possible. It keeps composable logic, the API connections to ODOO world and a git submodule pointer to template-odoo repository.

- **TEMPLATE-ODOO**: This is the project to start a new Alokai-odoo project. It's our main theme. So, if you want to start your own project, you'll need this repository to get start.

When we start a new project from **TEMPLATE-ODOO**, the npm package with odoo composables and apis will be injected.
